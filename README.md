# XwFindInBigFile

A simple big text file searcher

Many times we need to search inside files for particular text but opening a multi gigabyte text file is
not a simple task. Most text editors cant handle it.

This will allow you to search a text file, and return a few lines above and bellow the match.
The ideia is to consume as litle memory as possible.
